                        We are a local record store located in downtown Boise, Idaho. 
                        As we realize the world has turned to online record sales, we decided to open up
                        our music catalog to the internet and sell music online. While we offer an extensive collection
                        of digital music, we still are open for business and have an amazing collection of 
                        vinyl collectors items to offer. So stop on by and check out what we have to offer.
